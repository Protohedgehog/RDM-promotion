1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
Research data shall be free, digital, shared and re-usable.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,860
Only while open it will reach its true potential.

3
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,810
Fostering collaboration, open data accelerates research,

4
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,910
and even years after its production, by allowing easy preliminary and meta-analyses,

5
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,480
open data can bring research on the right track.

6
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,790
Open data provides a bulletproof defense

7
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,590
against accusation of misconduct or bad scientific practices.

8
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,860
Open data increases research visibility and paper citations,

9
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,940
and well organised,  open data does also fasten the research process.

10
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,010
Trustworthy results are efficiently and safely delivered,

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,980
and the research gets more chances to be published and funded.

12
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,780
Governments, funding agencies, universities, and publishers

13
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,890
have recognised the importance of opening research data.

14
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,720
and now, they REQUEST it, rightfully

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,000
But producing open data does not come without difficulties,

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,900
it indeed requires to modify the research workflow,

17
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,670
a process that does not go without pain and efforts.

18
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,550
But once data management has been implemented, data opening happens in a swing.

19
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,510
Indeed the data is then already FAIR,

20
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,890
difficulties got blocked by open, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable data.

21
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,960
In the end, good research always wins !

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,360
For society as well as for their careers,

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,970
researchers have to gear their data:

24
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,600
they must make it open and FAIR,

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,610
such that their data may fly away and save the day.
